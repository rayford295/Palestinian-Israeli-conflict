p,"The Israeli–Palestinian conflict is an ongoing military and political conflict in the Levant. Beginning in the mid-20th century, it is one of the world's longest-continuing conflicts.[3] Various attempts have been made to resolve the conflict as part of the Israeli–Palestinian peace process, alongside other efforts to resolve the broader Arab–Israeli conflict.[4][5][6][7] Public declarations of the desire to see a Jewish homeland established in Palestine, including the First Zionist Congress of 1897 and the Balfour Declaration of 1917, created early tensions in the region after waves of Jewish immigration. Following World War I, the Mandate for Palestine included a binding obligation for the ""establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people"". Tensions grew into open sectarian conflict between Jews and Arabs.[8][9] The 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was never implemented and provoked the 1947–1949 Palestine War. The current Israeli-Palestinian status quo began following Israeli military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, known as the Palestinian territories, in the 1967 Six-Day War.",the israelipalestinian conflict is an ongoing military and political conflict in the levant beginning in the midth century it is one of the worlds longestcontinuing conflicts various attempts have been made to resolve the conflict as part of the israelipalestinian peace process alongside other efforts to resolve the broader arabisraeli conflict public declarations of the desire to see a jewish homeland established in palestine including the first zionist congress of  and the balfour declaration of  created early tensions in the region after waves of jewish immigration following world war i the mandate for palestine included a binding obligation for the establishment in palestine of a national home for the jewish people tensions grew into open sectarian conflict between jews and arabs the  united nations partition plan for palestine was never implemented and provoked the  palestine war the current israelipalestinian status quo began following israeli military occupation of the west bank and gaza known as the palestinian territories in the  sixday war,israelipalestinian conflict ongoing military political conflict levant beginning midth century one worlds longestcontinuing conflicts various attempts been made resolve conflict part israelipalestinian peace process alongside other efforts resolve broader arabisraeli conflict public declarations desire see jewish homeland established palestine including first zionist congress balfour declaration created early tensions region after waves jewish immigration following world war i mandate palestine included binding obligation establishment palestine national home jewish people tensions grew into open sectarian conflict between jews arabs united nations partition plan palestine never implemented provoked palestine war current israelipalestinian status quo began following israeli military occupation west bank gaza known palestinian territories sixday war,0.0016666666666666663

The violence of the conflict in the region—rich in sites of historic, cultural, and religious interest worldwide—has been the subject of numerous international conferences dealing with historic rights, security issues, and human rights, and has been a factor limiting access to, and tourism in, areas that are highly contested.[12] The majority of peace efforts have been centred around the two-state solution, which involves the establishment of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.

p,"Within Israeli and Palestinian society, the conflict generates a wide variety of views and opinions, including that the violence perpetrated by the Israelis against the Palestinians is part of a genocide, and that Palestinians use worldwide terrorism to promote their interests. Since its inception, the conflict's casualties have not been restricted to combatants, with a large number of civilian fatalities on both sides. A minority of Jewish Israelis (32 percent) support a two-state solution with the Palestinians.[19] Israeli Jews are divided along ideological lines, and many favor maintaining the status quo.[17] Approximately 60 percent of Palestinians (77% in the Gaza Strip and 46% in the West Bank), support armed attacks against Israelis within Israel as a means of ending the occupation, while 70% believe that a two-state solution is no longer practical or possible as a result of the expansion of Israeli settlements.[18] More than two-thirds of Israeli Jews say that if the West Bank were annexed by Israel, Palestinians resident there should not be permitted to vote.[20] Mutual distrust and significant disagreements are deep over basic issues, as is the reciprocal skepticism about the other side's commitment to upholding obligations in an eventual bilateral agreement.[21] Since 2006, the Palestinian side has been fractured by conflict between Fatah, the traditionally dominant party, and its later electoral challenger, Hamas, a militant Islamist group that gained control of the Gaza Strip.[22] Attempts to remedy this have been repeated and continuing. Since 2019, the Israeli side has also been experiencing political upheaval, with four inconclusive legislative elections having been held over a span of two years.[23][24] The latest round of peace negotiations began in July 2013 but were suspended in 2014.

Among the results of the violence was the establishment of the Jewish paramilitary force Haganah.

p,"In the early 1930s, the Arab national struggle in Palestine had drawn many Arab nationalist militants from across the Middle East, such as Sheikh Izaddin al-Qassam from Syria, who established the Black Hand militant group and had prepared the grounds for the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. Following the death of al-Qassam at the hands of the British in late 1935, tensions erupted in 1936 into the Arab general strike and general boycott. The strike soon deteriorated into violence, and the Arab revolt was bloodily repressed by the British assisted by associated forces of the Jewish Settlement Police, the Jewish Supernumerary Police, and Special Night Squads.[28] In the first wave of organized violence, lasting until early 1937, most of the Arab groups were defeated by the British, and forced expulsion of much of the Arab leadership ensued. The revolt led to the establishment of the Peel Commission towards partitioning of Palestine, though it was subsequently rejected by the Palestinian Arabs. The two main Jewish leaders, Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion, accepted the recommendations but some secondary Jewish leaders disapproved of it.[31][32][33]",in the early s the arab national struggle in palestine had drawn many arab nationalist militants from across the middle east such as sheikh izaddin alqassam from syria who established the black hand militant group and had prepared the grounds for the  arab revolt in palestine following the death of alqassam at the hands of the british in late  tensions erupted in  into the arab general strike and general boycott the strike soon deteriorated into violence and the arab revolt was bloodily repressed by the british assisted by associated forces of the jewish settlement police the jewish supernumerary police and special night squads in the first wave of organized violence lasting until early  most of the arab groups were defeated by the british and forced expulsion of much of the arab leadership ensued the revolt led to the establishment of the peel commission towards partitioning of palestine though it was subsequently rejected by the palestinian arabs the two main jewish leaders chaim weizmann and david bengurion accepted the recommendations but some secondary jewish leaders disapproved of it,early s arab national struggle palestine drawn many arab nationalist militants across middle east such sheikh izaddin alqassam syria who established black hand militant group prepared grounds arab revolt palestine following death alqassam hands british late tensions erupted into arab general strike general boycott strike soon deteriorated into violence arab revolt bloodily repressed british assisted associated forces jewish settlement police jewish supernumerary police special night squads first wave organized violence lasting until early most arab groups were defeated british forced expulsion much arab leadership ensued revolt led establishment peel commission towards partitioning palestine though subsequently rejected palestinian arabs two main jewish leaders chaim weizmann david bengurion accepted recommendations but some secondary jewish leaders disapproved,0.015079365079365081
p,"The renewed violence, which continued sporadically until the beginning of World War II, ended with around 5,000 casualties, mostly from the Arab side. With the eruption of World War II, the situation in Mandatory Palestine calmed down. It allowed a shift towards a more moderate stance among Palestinian Arabs under the leadership of the Nashashibi clan and even the establishment of the Jewish–Arab Palestine Regiment under British command, fighting Germans in North Africa. The more radical exiled faction of al-Husseini, however, tended to cooperate with Nazi Germany, and participated in the establishment of a pro-Nazi propaganda machine throughout the Arab world. The defeat of Arab nationalists in Iraq and subsequent relocation of al-Husseini to Nazi-occupied Europe tied his hands regarding field operations in Palestine, though he regularly demanded that the Italians and the Germans bomb Tel Aviv. By the end of World War II, a crisis over the fate of the Holocaust survivors from Europe led to renewed tensions between the Yishuv and the Palestinian Arab leadership.
